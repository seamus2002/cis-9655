The Olympic Games bring together the world’s best athletes to compete at the highest level. However, success in the Olympics is influenced by more than just individual talent. In this study, we explore the key factors that determine a country’s or an athlete’s success in the Olympic Games. Specifically, we focus on factors beyond an athlete’s control—a country’s population size, athlete age, and a country’s GDP—and how these elements impact Olympic performance.

Our hypothesis is that population, age, and GDP influence Olympic success. Countries with larger populations have a bigger talent pool, increasing their chances of winning more medals. Age plays a crucial role as each sport has an optimal performance age, affecting an athlete’s likelihood of success. Additionally, countries with higher GDPs can provide better support, giving their athletes a competitive advantage.
<br><br>
To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from six recent Olympic Games: 2012 London Summer Olympics, 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, 2016 Rio Summer Olympics, 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, and 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. Due to a lack of available data, the 2024 Paris Olympics was excluded from our analysis.
